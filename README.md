# Gilded Rose Tech-Test

Whilst completing this test I have appraoched the problems with a TDD and OO mindset.

This has been very interesting as through my mistakes I have leanred how to breakdown my steps to approaching legacy code.

The steps I would take in order;

1 - Read and understand the instructions very well
2 - Run the tests
3 - Look at the error messages
4 - Implement additional testing for feature and unit tests
5 - Look to DRY out extisting code base
6 - Try not to touch the original code too much
7 - Create a new class in place of exsting code which is very difficult to change
8 - Try not to inherit from unflexible classes which are unwelcoming to change and have many dependents
